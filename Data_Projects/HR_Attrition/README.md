## 🧠 Project Overview
This project explores **employee turnover patterns** within a dataset of **311 employees** to identify the key drivers of attrition and estimate potential cost savings from targeted interventions.  
Analyses were performed in **R** using tidyverse libraries, with results summarized in an interactive RMarkdown report and presentation deck.

---

### 🔍 Key Findings
- **Tenure** emerged as the **strongest predictor of turnover**, followed by **department type and job role**.  
- **First-year Production employees** were at the **highest risk** of leaving the organization.  
- ROI simulation estimated that a **5% reduction in first-year Production attrition** could yield **annual savings of ~$375K**.  
- Results highlight the need for improved **onboarding, job-fit, and early engagement strategies**.

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques Used
- **R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, janitor, lubridate)** for data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization  
- **RMarkdown** for reproducible analysis and executive reporting  
- **PowerPoint** for summarizing insights and ROI recommendations

## 🏁 Results & Takeaways
- Early-tenure attrition represents the **greatest opportunity for cost savings**.  
- **Targeted retention programs** in Production roles could significantly improve ROI.  
- **Tenure, engagement, and job satisfaction metrics** should be tracked continuously to inform future interventions.
