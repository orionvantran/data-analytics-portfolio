- Analyzed attrition patterns using an HR dataset (311 employee records from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set))  
- Found **tenure is the strongest predictor of turnover**, with **first-year Production employees at the highest risk**  
- Developed an **ROI estimate** showing that a **5% reduction in first-year Production attrition could save ~$375K annually**

- Found **Technology** as the top-performing category (**~16% margin**) and **Furniture** as the weakest (‚Äúhigh sales, low profit‚Äù)  
- Created **dynamic KPI cards, slicers, and trend charts** using Excel PivotTables and Power Query transformations
